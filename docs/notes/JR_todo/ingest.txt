Love this direction — Stream 8.1 is now wired up end‑to‑end with a real Tauri watcher and routing.

What I changed

Implemented a Tauri file watcher with routing + zip extraction and event emissions in ingest.rs, and registered commands/state in lib.rs.
Added a client hook that starts/stops the watcher and listens for ingest events, updating store history in useIngestWatcher.ts and page.tsx.
Extended the ingest slice to accept live ingest records in store.ts.
Documented Stream 8.1 completion in docs/notes/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md.
Added Rust deps in Cargo.toml.
How it works (quick)

When the watcher sees a new file in Downloads, it matches by project or artist name and moves files to the correct project folder (Audio Files, Sessions, References).
Zip files are extracted into Imports/<zipName> then routed by file type.
Each result emits an ingest:event that updates ingestHistory live.
Tests
Not run (no test command requested).

Suggested quick verification

Run the Tauri app and make sure Settings > Downloads Path points to a real folder.
Drop a file named with an artist or project into Downloads, e.g. AvaMonroe_Vocal_Take3.wav.
Check the Ingest panel history and the project folder paths.
If you want me to tighten routing (e.g., handle ambiguous artist matches or add fallback rules), I can do that next.
